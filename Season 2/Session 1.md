[[Season 2]] session 1



For 3 days I've been Jorje has been limbo, walking around a purple shroud full of happy memories. Gold strings are plucked, and a voice reaches out through it, speaking through the aniscroll.

  

When the clouds form into a memory, we see soldiers raising a flag atop a pile of dead, surround by wiredfolk. Towns folk are empty eyed and buildings are covered with moss, as a voiceover tells us of the amazing things that Urbyr has accomplished

  
  

The ship jolts and we awake.  We are aboard the SS Plutus, getting ready for trials where rebels are punished. We are above the ocean, far from land, and as the ship begins to turn we can hear people shouting about navigation and stoking fires. We're an hour and a half away, and a team is waiting for us including a cleric who will heal any injuries we sustain on the journey. 

  

The ship is made of purple metal with a floor made of a kind of foam that allows the air to circulate. The windows are semi circular. 

  

We are bound in manacles fastened to the floor, all of our belongings have gone, and we're only wearing a Lycra onesie. There are more seats, but they are empty. There are 2 guards that we can see. Ari struggles against their bind and seems to be hurt by them.

  

We create a racket and a wiredfolk comes to check to us, that seems uncannily human. He tells us we're going to the island of vow to compete in trials to make up for our misgivings against Urbyr. Greg, the half elf guard calls him back and mutters about wiredfolk not doing anything right. We distract the elf for a while, until an explosion rocks the plane and smoke pours from the cockpit. The wiredfolk runs out of the cockpit, and in it is standing a flawless blonde asimar. Our manacles fall free and we jump to our feet, but after a struggle we are all forced back into them.

  

After a time, the aniscroll announces our arrival at the vow Islands. Eye bots hover in front of our face and tekes mugshots and a hooded cleric heals us up, we recognise him as the Wraith of Penoria, a cleric who often heals the wounded on both sides of the conflict.

  

We are led to a room where a tabaxi lady takes us, one at a time, into a room where a camera is pointed at us. The others give a profile of themselves to the viewers to earn the chance of items. In my case, the tabaxi recognises me and says "a friend of a friend sends their regards" and the light goes red, and I'm shuffled out into a magically dark room. Orbs of light appear and we are lifted high into you sky, showing us islands below. A voice tells us how the winner of the trials will win the chance at rehabilitation in godhurthia. The manacles fall off and we drop into free fall about 200ft off the ground.

  

Beasts surround us, and we can see a gelatinous cubes below. We defeat them and bags fall from the sky with name tags on, none for me. In an unnamed bag I find a +1 spear with a geometric pattern. It glows with light similar to two beams at the far end of the arena. We open a few more chests and eat good berries for sustenance, but a tentacle grabs Uriel from a small puddle, and then they get grabbed by a living hand surrounding another chest. I polymorph the tentacle monster into a goldfish. We retrieve the crate from the hand and it opens using the spear. Within is a potion of greater healing for everyone, and a few care packages. 7 green Tamerlane worth 100gp each, a figure of shielding, a bag of diamonds, and a +1 shield

  

In another chest we find an eye ball? That triggers another encounter

[[Season 2]] session 3



*If you're going to interrupt, at least say something funny.*

  

We are trapped under the water, there seem to be glass walls around us. The water feels thicker than we are used to, and it's difficult to move.

  

A Tabaxi appears behind Ari moving quickly and unaffected by the water. Behind me, a middle aged dwarf rushes me down, saying I have something of his. Sigmund? When we make it all into a single box, the water drains away. In the center is a chest with an outfit for Wes. We see islands brightly lit by a never ending night sky. Between us and them is a drawbridge that needs weight adding to be down, it is hundreds of feet long. The weight looks to be the size of a large boulder, doubtless a few feet. We pull the chain down, and I hold it in place with stone shadow

  

The next island is 50ftx50ft, at the center is an obsidian statue of a woman with a button in one hand. At her feet is a chest. This seems to be Urbyr. In the chest is a diamond and a rusty battle axe for wraith. I press the button, and a couldron appears in the corner, flanked by 2 walls

  

The following Island is the same. The chest contains boots of elvenkind. When the button is pressed, a door opens and a wiredfolk wanders out holding an aniscroll that shows a trifling adorned with emeralds including an emerald tooth. We do riddles, they are bad. Alexander wren sends one to me that is "what makes you cry when you cut it?" I answer Claudi, the answer is skin. We get the rest correct and move to the next island. 

  

We must impress a sphinx after solving a riddle, in order to pass over the next bridge. This final island has the statues hand almost entirely claspsed over the button. We get the cypher and a spell scroll of grease. As we press the button, the island disappears and we are pulled downwards as there is a loud screech and an adult white dragon swoops up at us. We defeat it and take a bunch of loot including 5 vouchers to any XL guild establishment, featuring a winking teifling 

  
  

We jump into the well after finding the key and go back into the stream. We have been in for about 5 minutes before the githyanki gets in touch, it says to stay safe and watch out for bears. We fall into a deep sleep

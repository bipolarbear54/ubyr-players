[[Season 2]] session 2

**

A stone giant manifests but we manage to take it down pretty quickly. As it died, a  bead drops out that seems to be translucent with a storm within. When we try to put it in the bag of holding, it bounces back out. When it breaks open, a large, bloodied body is spat out of it, covered in wounds and dressed the same as us. He introduces himself as wraith. We recognize him as the cleric who healed us as we got off the ship.

  

After further fighting, against a rot troll called Gregg, we get another chest which contains a blue key amongst other things. I get mithrall half plate from a care package.

  

We unlock the pyramid by... Shooting each other against the wheel to turn it, since we're all weak as shit. On the pyramid we get ganked by all kinds of things, but I find a  Mindful pawn: +1 to wisdom save when attuned. We get attacked by mummies and in the remaining chests we find healing potions and A yellow key. On the island we find weapons, and a well for the yellow key. On the opposite side of the island is a blue dragon. Underneath the well is a seemingly infinite chasm, and a rock we drop down it seems to indicate that gravity is going in a different direction. Uriel flies in in wildshape and disappears. I jump in next, leaving my echo behind so I can blink back.

  

Streams of light Wizz past, and the idea of time passing seems alien and sickening. 2 githyanki appear in front of us, seemingly glitching, along with an elderly tortle. Gin and Ginlath are astral projecting into the shunt stream and they're attempting a rescue but need time. Stay alive, stay safe, the truth is in the darkness. The broadcast ends with tentacles impaled with old weapons. We are plunges into water
